Winning Percentage Analysis: You can look at the win-loss-draw records of players to determine their relative strengths. 
This can be done overall, or you can segregate the data by opponents' strengths, game conditions (like time controls), or other factors.

Opening Theory Analysis: Analyze which openings are most commonly used, and how successful they are. 
You can break this down by player, by skill level, or other factors. This kind of analysis can 
help determine the effectiveness of different opening strategies.

Piece Value Analysis: By looking at the pieces taken by each player, you can try to quantify how effectively each 
player is using their pieces. This can also be used to test the traditional piece values 
(pawn = 1, knight/bishop = 3, rook = 5, queen = 9).

Endgame Analysis: You can look at games that reached an endgame and analyze which players are most successful 
in these situations. You can break down this analysis by the type of endgame, the material balance, and so on.

Move Quality Analysis: Using a chess engine, you can evaluate the quality of each move in a game. 
This can help you understand how often players make blunders, make the best move, or make sub-optimal moves.

Performance Rating Analysis: Performance rating is a calculated measure based on the 
ratings of one's opponents and the results against them. By comparing a player's actual rating 
with their performance rating, you can identify players who are over-performing or under-performing their ratings.

Game Length Analysis: Analyzing the length of games can give insights into players' playing styles. 
Some players might prefer longer, strategic battles, while others might excel at shorter, tactical games.

Historical Trend Analysis: By analyzing chess data over time, you can identify trends in 
popularity and success rates of different openings, strategies, or endgames.

1. after I have formatted all chess data, and then trained the agents on all games, the Q table can be repurposed. 
I can zero out the values, and then count how many time one of the unique chess moves is played across all games 
in the db.
